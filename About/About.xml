        <h1>Why?</h1>
    At first, I was going to make this mod about just adding a gene for "miracle" pregnancies, aimed at Female Supremacy playthroughs, but I quickly diverged my thoughts to "I should make a race, just a gene seems weird." The Dream-Eaters are a result of that.
        <h1>Content</h1>
    This mod introduces a new Xenotype based on classic succubi/incubi from fantasy stories. They are ageless and extremely beautiful, but they are not immortal. Hailing from the Void, they have unnatural abilities that allow them to "eat" the dreams of people while they are asleep.
